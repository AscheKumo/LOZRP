# LOZRP — Static RP Character Sheet

This is a single-page, offline-friendly, static HTML character sheet inspired by **The Legend of Zelda**.

## Use

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Fill in fields.
- Use **Save** / **Load** (stored in your browser via localStorage).
- Use **Export JSON** to download a backup; **Import JSON** to restore.

## Theme / Background

- The page uses a fixed (non-scrolling) background image for a Hyrule/Zelda vibe.
- The CSS currently references: `legend-of-zelda-retro-link-desktop-wallpaper-4k.jpg` (already in this folder).
- If you want to swap the background, replace that file or update the URL in `styles.css`.

## Notes

This project is fan-made and not affiliated with Nintendo.
